* hw2 requires basic understanding of encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism,
*	garbage collection and pointer ownership.
* Inheritance: Rectangle and Triangle implements Polygon interface.
* Encapsulation: Points are private attributes, no setter is provided to change dimensions.
* Polymorhism:
	Rectangle and Polygon overrides Polygon#GetArea and Polygon#GetPoint.
	While iterating vector<Polygons> there is no need to use conditional statements to check the type of polygon.
* In test/polygon-test initialized vector<<unique_ptr>Polygon>, this allows for automatic garbage collection.
