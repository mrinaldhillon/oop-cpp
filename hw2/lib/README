* hw2 requires basic understanding of encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism
* Inheritance: Rectangle and Triangle implements Polygon interface.
* Encapsulation: Points are private attributes, no setter is provided to change dimensions.
* Polymorhism:
	Rectangle and Polygon overrides Polygon#GetArea and Polygon#GetPoint.
		Since Polygon is abstract class with virtual fucntions are we really overriding Polygon's functions?
	While iterating vector <Polygons *> we don't conditional statements to check the type of polygon.
